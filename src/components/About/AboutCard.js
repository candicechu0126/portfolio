            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Candice CHU </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Hong Kong.</span>
            <br />I am a final year bachelorâ€™s degree student in Electronic
            Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
            and will grate in this summer. Through my professional training and
            studies, I have acquired knowledge and programming skills in
            application or website design. During my studies, I completed
            project and presentation on the smart shuttle bus and smart garbage,
            which provided me with hands-on experience designing IOT-related
            hardware and software combination technologies. This strengthened my
            high-level analytical thinking and organizational skills
            Additionally, my experience working as a web/mobile application
            quality analyst has taught me how to effectively communicate product
            concepts and techniques, and even how to test products and search
            the solutions for the problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
